Netflix Clone â€” HTML | CSS | JavaScript
Welcome to my Netflix Clone â€” a sleek, responsive, and visually engaging recreation of Netflix's homepage built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project highlights my front-end development skills and attention to UI/UX design, with smooth layouts and interactive features that mirror the real Netflix interface.
Key Highlights:

Hero Section: Eye-catching banner area showcasing featured content

Scrollable Movie Rows: Horizontally scrollable carousels with hover animations

Custom Styling: Clean design and intuitive user experience

Pure Front-End: Built without frameworks or libraries â€” just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

This project was developed as part of my front-end learning journey to:

Practice real-world UI cloning
-->Strengthen skills in layout, positioning, and responsive design.
-->Understand dynamic content presentation using JavaScript.
-->Recreate a popular platform using only core web technologies.
